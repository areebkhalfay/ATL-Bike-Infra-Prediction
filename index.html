                            <p>Bike-sharing systems have emerged as a promising solution for urban mobility challenges,
                                particularly in congested cities. Studies have shown that successful bike-sharing
                                implementations can significantly impact urban transportation patterns. The Capital
                                Bikeshare system in Washington, D.C., for example, led to a 4% reduction in traffic
                                congestion in dense areas <sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>. However, the success of
                                these systems heavily depends on careful planning and accurate demand prediction.
                                Research has demonstrated that weather conditions, temporal patterns, and urban
                                infrastructure significantly influence bike-sharing usage. Studies of New York's Citi
                                Bike system revealed that precipitation, temperature, and humidity are crucial factors
                                affecting ridership patterns <sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup>.
                                Additionally, research has shown that the presence of dedicated cycling infrastructure,
                                such as protected bike lanes, correlates strongly with increased ridership <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup>.
                            </p>
                            <p>The use of bicycles in urban areas across the
                                United States is also influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic, demographic,
                                and cultural factors. Income level and race play significant roles in determining access
                                to and engagement with bike-sharing programs. Despite high levels of interest among
                                people of color (POC), actual membership and usage rates lag behind those of
                                higher-income white individuals, largely due to barriers such as cost and lack of
                                accessible, relevant information. Interestingly, attitudes toward cycling and social
                                networks—such as friends and family who bike—strongly predict engagement among POC,
                                especially for recreational use, suggesting that targeted outreach and inclusive
                                messaging could help bridge this gap <sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>. Age also
                                significantly affects cycling trends. While individuals aged 18–34 are more likely to
                                cycle for commuting or leisure, physical limitations and safety concerns contribute to a
                                marked decline in cycling among older adults, particularly those over 60 <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. Yet, data from 2001 to 2009 show that individuals
                                aged 40–64 saw the most substantial growth in cycling, highlighting evolving age-related
                                patterns and possibly the impact of health and fitness awareness in that demographic
                                <sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>. </p>
                            <p>Gender disparities are also evident, with men
                                accounting for nearly all of the growth in U.S. cycling between 2001 and 2009, “while
                                women's participation remained stagnant and children's cycling sharply declined” <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>. This gender gap is further compounded by broader
                                socioeconomic factors. Unlike Northern European countries where cycling is more
                                gender-balanced, North America has seen disproportionately higher growth in male
                                cyclists, especially for utilitarian purposes, which correlates with broader trends in
                                transportation accessibility and cultural norms <sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>. Car
                                ownership and income are additional variables that shape cycling behavior; Studies show
                                that in the early 2000s, “income did not appear to significantly influence cycling rates
                                in the U.S., with bike usage relatively consistent across all income levels. Over time,
                                however, subtle patterns began to emerge suggesting that lower-income individuals may
                                rely more on bicycles for utilitarian purposes such as commuting to work or fulfilling
                                daily needs, whereas higher-income individuals are more likely to use bikes for
                                recreational or fitness-related activities” <sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>, <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a></sup>, <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-10">[10]</a></sup>. </p>
                            <p>This shift points to a growing differentiation in
                                how various income groups engage with cycling, driven in part by their transportation
                                needs and access to alternatives. “Car ownership has increasingly become a key factor in
                                determining cycling behavior. Households without cars—or with limited access to
                                vehicles—are significantly more likely to use bicycles compared to households with
                                multiple cars”. This pattern reflects a practical reliance on bicycles in the absence of
                                motor vehicles and is supported by research indicating a strong inverse relationship
                                between car ownership and cycling rates <sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>, <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a></sup>, <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-13">[13]</a></sup>. </p>
                            <p>Additionally, “while non-Hispanic whites still
                                account for the majority of bike trips in the U.S., cycling is growing more rapidly
                                among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans”. This shift suggests an
                                increasing diversification of cycling demographics, although white cyclists still
                                dominate overall participation rates <sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>, <sup><a
                                        href="#ref-14">[14]</a></sup>. Education also plays a pivotal role in shaping
                                bicycle use patterns. Individuals with higher education levels are more likely to cycle
                                for transportation, possibly due to proximity to universities or workplaces within
                                biking distance, while those with lower education levels are more inclined to use bikes
                                for recreational purposes <sup><a href="#ref-15">[15]</a></sup>. Thus, understanding the
                                nuanced impact of these overlapping factors is crucial for developing equitable and
                                effective cycling infrastructure and policy. The challenge of predicting demand in
                                cities without established bike-sharing systems has been addressed through various
                                methodological approaches. </p>
                            <p>Machine learning techniques, particularly those incorporating
                                users' composition, and spatial and temporal travel patterns have shown promise in
                                predicting bike-sharing demand <sup><a href="#ref-16">[16]</a></sup>. These models can
                                potentially help cities like Atlanta understand likely usage patterns before significant
                                infrastructure investment. Also, one motivational point for considering this project is
                                that Atlanta’s transformation into a more bike-friendly city is gaining momentum,
                                earning it the nickname “Atlamsterdam”. With 85% of the 22-mile Beltline loop either
                                open or under construction, and projects like Silver Comet Connector progressing
                                rapidly, the city is enhancing its cycling infrastructure significantly (see <b>Figure
                                    1</b>). </p>
                            <p>These developments not only promote healthier lifestyles and reduce traffic
                                congestion but also connect diverse neighborhoods, fostering a more inclusive urban
                                environment. Implementing dedicated bike lanes is a crucial step toward realizing this
                                vision, making Atlanta safer and more accessible for all residents.<sup><a

                                According to all the points discussed above, our project investigates whether we can use
                                bike activity trends from other cities – specifically NYC- to predict bike activity in
                                localized areas around Atlanta.</p>

                        <div class="col-12">
                            <p>Atlanta faces severe traffic congestion despite lower population density than other major
                                cities. While places like New York and Chicago rely on public transit, Atlanta remains
                                car-dependent, with MARTA expansion efforts stalled. Bicycling could offer an
                                alternative to car commuting, but the city faces a circular problem: low ridership
                                discourages infrastructure investment, while limited infrastructure deters potential
                                cyclists. This creates uncertainty about the benefits of expanding bike infrastructure.
                                To address this, we developed a supervised learning model that predicts potential bike
                                ridership patterns in Atlanta using data from New York City (NYC), which has robust bike
                                infrastructure and strong bike activity. We train three supervised learning models
                                (neural network, linear regression, and decision tree). This analysis aims to provide
                                urban planners with quantitative insights for creating a more bike-friendly Atlanta.
                                Also, we tried to apply an SVM model to classify the weather data into good weather and
                                bad weather, however, we encountered several challenges and obstacles. Therefore,
                                although we tried different data engineering and approaches, due to the problems in our
                                weather dataset, we could not use the SVM model in the deployment to Atlanta. The
                                details of all of these processes will be discussed in the following sections in more
                                detail.</p>

                        <p>To guide our project systematically, we initially developed a detailed pseudocode framework
                            that served as a structured roadmap (first version). As the project progressed and new
                            challenges and insights emerged, we adapted and refined the original pseudocode to better
                            reflect the actual implementation and decisions made during development. Both the initial
                            version and the updated, final version of the pseudocode are included in the Appendix for
                            reference, illustrating the evolution of our approach throughout the project.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4">
                            <p>We implemented a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline on the NYC census and Citibike
                                datasets to ensure data quality and consistency before model training. To guide this
                                effort, we designed a detailed preprocessing roadmap that outlined each step in the
                                workflow, clearly defining the inputs, transformations, and expected outputs. This
                                roadmap not only helped maintain systematic consistency across the pipeline but also
                                facilitated easier debugging and documentation. The preprocessing steps related to
                                demographic data (Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.5 and 5.3.7) and grid generation (Section 5.3.6)
                                were applied uniformly to both NYC and Atlanta to maintain comparability across cities.
                                However, the procedures related to bike activity data (Sections 5.3.8 through 5.3.10)
                                were specific to NYC, as Atlanta does not currently have available bike ride data. This
                                lack of data reinforces the value of our predictive modeling effort, which aims to
                                estimate bike demand in Atlanta based on transferable patterns learned from NYC
                                data.</p>

                            <p>We began by collecting and integrating data from multiple resources, carefully
                                consolidating all the required information from various databases into a unified dataset
                                that would serve as our foundation for analysis. We exported New York Census Data
                                features from the official 2020 US Census and the 2020 American Community Survey. The
                                output of this step was a .csv file <em>[nyc_data_numeric.csv]</em>.</p>

                            <p>We then normalized each feature in <em>[nyc_data_numeric.csv]</em> via z-score
                                normalization (standardization), which transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a
                                standard deviation of 1.</p>

                                convergence. We chose Z-score normalization because it is (1) less sensitive to outliers
                                than min-max scaling, and (2) conducive to the interpretability, training stability, and
                                model performance of some algorithms (e.g., linear regression, Principal Component
                                Analysis). Applying z-score standardization to <em>[nyc_data_numeric.csv]</em> yields

                            <p>For features that do not follow a normal distribution after standard z-score
                                normalization, we consider alternative approaches such as centroid-based scaling. This
                                method can enhance the robustness of models like linear regression and neural networks
                                by reducing the influence of outliers. However, it may also compromise accuracy in some
                                scenarios. An alternative to z-score normalization, winsorization, was also considered
                                to mitigate the impact of extreme values while preserving the overall distribution
                                structure. Given the typically small differences between these normalization methods in
                                real-world datasets, we do not expect a significant impact on downstream modeling
                                outcomes.</p>

                            <p>Census parcels with missing values were imputed using one of two methods:</p>

                                        the East–West axis of Manhattan, where the urban layout is more elongated in the
                                        North–South direction—we apply one of the following imputation methods:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Averaging of Adjacent Parcels: The missing value is replaced with the
                                            average of two geographically adjacent parcels.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Direct Substitution: The raw value from the nearest parcel is used as the
                                            replacement.

                                        <li>Decay-Weighted Substitution: A decay factor is applied (e.g., 80% of the raw
                                            value from the nearest parcel) to better represent attenuation or diffusion
                                            of the measured phenomenon.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Directional Rule-Based Substitution: A spatial heuristic is applied—if the
                                            parcel is located on the East side of Manhattan, the full raw value is used
                                            for substitution; if on the West side, only 70% of the raw value is applied.

                                    <p>If no reasonable estimate of a nearby parcel could be determined—such as when
                                        neighboring GeoIDs (e.g., ±1) did not yield meaningful spatial relationships—the
                                        affected parcel will be excluded from further analysis. This can be done under

                                        cycling activity, and their exclusion would not adversely impact model

                                        tracts (which could vary in size and shape) to a uniform grid of square spatial
                                        units. This allowed greater granularity of analysis (each census tract is
                                        converted to multiple grid squares) and simplified the process of determining
                                        which spatial unit each bike ride fell into. It also facilitated comparison
                                        between cities, as different cities may have different census tract sizes.</p>

                                    <p>We defined our grid with 1000x1000ft cells, based on the 15-minute walkability
                                        score. Prior literature suggests 500x500-ft cells, but this resulted in
                                        approximately 99,000 grid cells which was computationally infeasible given our
                                        resources (taking approximately 6-8 hours to generate the basic grid
                                        metrics).</p>
                                    <p>Using 1000x1000 ft cells resulted in 5,444 grid cells <b>(see Figure 9)</b>. Many
                                        of these cells were entirely in water or did not contain Citi Bike stations.
                                        This geographic distribution insight presented a methodological challenge:
                                        differentiating between grid cells with zero ridership due to lack of usage
                                        versus grid cells with zero ridership due to the absence of Citi Bike stations
                                        entirely. Including areas without stations would potentially skew the analysis
                                        by treating areas without infrastructure as equivalent to areas with
                                        infrastructure but no usage. Thus, we refined the geographic boundaries to
                                        exclude areas without Citi Bike stations, specifically Staten Island and other
                                        regions clearly outside the service area as identified on the Citi Bike station
                                        map. In this regard, this optimization approach provided several benefits:</p>

                                        <li>Eliminated data skewing from areas without Citi Bike infrastructure</li>

                            <p>The target variable for prediction was the Citi Bike ride count at each grid cell. The
                                original scale target variable y, the ride count data, is strongly right-skewed and
                                exhibits non-constant. error variance across the range of predicted values, indicating a
                                violation of the homoscedasticity assumption in linear regression. This phenomenon,
                                known as heteroscedasticity, can lead to inefficient parameter estimates and unreliable
                                statistical inference. Moreover, it may hinder the convergence of neural networks by
                                introducing instability in the learning process due to uneven gradient magnitudes. So we
                                applied a logarithmic transformation using the formula log(Ride Count + 1). This helps
                                stabilize variance, reduce the impact of outliers, and approximate a normal
                                distribution, which is a key assumption of linear regression models. To identify the
                                most relevant input variables, feature selection was performed using SelectKBest with
                                F-regression scoring. This univariate statistical method evaluates each feature
                                individually based on its linear correlation with the target, selecting the top 25

                                <li>&Beta;<sub>i</sub> represents the coefficient corresponding to feature <em>i</em>,
                                </li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The model was built on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, a classical linear
                                modeling technique that fits a hyperplane through the feature space by minimizing the
                                residual sum of squares between the observed and predicted target values. OLS has a
                                closed-form solution, meaning the optimal coefficients can be computed analytically
                                without iterative optimization, ensuring fast and deterministic results. Initially, we
                                trained the model using the original feature set with OLS loss. The data exhibits a
                                low-to-moderate dimensionality structure, with the number of features representing
                                approximately 1.9% of the number of data points. In such settings, regularization is not
                                strictly necessary; however, we evaluated Ridge and Elastic Net regression to assess
                                model stability under penalization. We observed that the regularized models achieved
                                improved training performance as the hyperparameters (e.g., L1-ratio and alpha)
                                decreased. However, their test set R-squared values remained lower than that of the OLS
                                model. This outcome suggests that in our case, the simpler OLS model may generalize
                                better, and penalization might be unnecessary – especially given that we had already
                                applied z-score normalization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to preprocess the
                                features. To further examine model agreement, we computed the Spearman correlation
                                between the predicted y values from the OLS, Ridge, Elastic Net models. All pairwise
                                correlations were close to 1, indicating that the predictions are highly aligned. This
                                suggests limited benefit in ensembling these models.</p>

                            <p>Our third supervised learning model was a decision tree regressor, implemented using the
                                scikit-learn DecisionTreeRegressor class. Decision trees provide an interpretable,
                                rule-based model that could capture non-linear relationships between demographic
                                features and bike usage. They are capable of modeling non-linear interactions and
                                hierarchical decision-making patterns without requiring feature scaling. Furthermore,
                                they provide interpretability through their branching logic, which is valuable when
                                attempting to understand how different features contribute to ridership predictions.
                                Given that prior models like linear regression assume linearity and neural networks
                                require substantial tuning, decision trees served as a strong baseline for flexible
                                modeling with minimal assumptions.</p>

                            <p>We aimed to train SVM to classify NYC days as good weather and bad weather and learn a
                                ratio between ride volume in good weather and bad weather. By applying SVM exclusively
                                to the weather data subset, the third model would have been introducing a distinct
                                modeling approach compared to the previously implemented linear regression and neural
                                network models. This methodological diversity not only was supposed to enrich the
                                analysis but also had the potential to uncover unique insights into how weather
                                conditions influence bike usage—insights that could not be captured as effectively by
                                the other models. Although the SVM model was implemented and trained on the NYC weather
                                data, the test answer did not work very well due to several issues in the weather data.

                                data</small></p>
                            <p>As part of the project, we intended to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to
                                classify NYC days as either good weather or bad weather based on historical weather
                                conditions. The goal was to integrate this classification into our bike demand
                                prediction framework and compute a ratio of ride volume between good and bad weather
                                conditions. However, we encountered a fundamental issue in the structure of the weather
                                dataset that prevented successful application of the SVM. The weather dataset was rich
                                in temporal granularity, offering frequent observations throughout each day. However, it
                                was fundamentally structured as a time-series dataset rather than a location-series
                                dataset. This means that while we had numerous weather observations across different
                                times of day, all data entries were geotagged to only two distinct latitude and
                                longitude coordinates—corresponding to just two weather stations, NYC and Manhattan. As
                                illustrated in the attached image:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The dataset primarily recorded hourly weather variables (e.g., temperature,
                                    humidity, wind speed) from these two stations.
                                </li>
                                <li>These observations lacked geographic variety and were concentrated spatially in only
                                    two locations.
                                </li>
                                <li>Consequently, all data points, regardless of time, belonged to either Station 1 or
                                    Station 2.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This spatial limitation introduced a major challenge: we had to assign localized weather
                                data to a city-wide grid despite having only two reference points. In essence, this
                                meant taking all the weather observations from these two "baskets" and attempting to
                                extrapolate them across a diverse urban grid that covers the entire NYC area. So, since
                                all the weather datapoints were flattened in two stations, we tried to assign
                                representative weather values to each grid cell:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For each grid cell, we found the nearest weather station.</li>
                                <li>From that station's data, we randomly selected a data point (typically from the same
                                    day) to represent the cell's weather condition.
                                </li>
                                <li>This point was then assigned to the corresponding grid cell.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Then we defined good weather and bad weather <sup><a href="#ref-21">[21]</a></sup>, <sup><a

                            <p>Despite our efforts to integrate weather conditions into our analysis by randomly
                                distributing weather data across NYC grid cells, this approach introduced several
                                fundamental limitations that ultimately led to a geographically unrealistic and
                                homogeneous classification of weather conditions—specifically, the distinction between
                                “good” and “bad” weather. These issues stem from both the structure of the weather
                                dataset and the methods required to compensate for its limitations. The weather dataset
                                was sourced from only two fixed-location stations in NYC, providing a rich set of
                                time-series observations (i.e., multiple measurements throughout each day), but no
                                location-series variation (i.e., diverse geographic coverage across the city).
                                Consequently, all weather entries were tied to just two latitude-longitude coordinates.
                                To adapt this data for our grid-based urban modeling, we randomly assigned weather
                                observations to each of the 5,544 grid cells that compose our study area. However, this
                                random spatial assignment introduced four major issues:</p>
                            <p><b>Loss of geographic context:</b> Since each weather data point was not originally tied
                                to a specific geographic area, we could not determine where it truly belonged within the
                                city. Assigning such data randomly to a grid cell means there's a high risk of
                                misplacing weather conditions—for example, associating a rainstorm observation with a
                                sunny region. This can distort the perceived correlation between weather conditions and
                                bike ride volumes in those regions.</p>
                            <p><b>Inconsistency across adjacent grids:</b> In reality, weather conditions are generally
                                continuous over short distances—especially within a dense urban environment. Given that
                                each of our grid cells measures just 1,000 x 1,000 feet, it's unreasonable for two
                                adjacent cells to be classified under opposite weather conditions (e.g., one as “good”
                                and one as “bad”) on the same day. However, our random assignment process made such
                                contradictions not only possible but statistically likely, thereby reducing the
                                geographic credibility of our model’s weather layer.</p>
                            <p><b>Overextension of limited data:</b> On any given day, the dataset included only 193
                                unique weather records, all from two stations. Yet, we needed to populate 5,544 grid
                                cells. To bridge this gap, we had to replicate and assign the same limited weather data
                                across a much larger spatial framework. This naturally led to a homogeneous distribution
                                of weather values across the city, where many grid cells shared identical or nearly
                                identical data, undermining the richness and variability required for nuanced spatial
                                analysis.</p>
                            <p><b>Negative impact on predictive modeling:</b> One of our key modeling goals was to
                                calculate and compare ride volumes in good versus bad weather conditions. However, due
                                to the random and potentially inconsistent distribution of weather classifications, the
                                model’s foundational assumptions were compromised. This could lead to inaccurate ratio
                                calculations and undermine the reliability of predictions. In essence, the model might
                                misattribute a drop in ride volume to bad weather in a certain region when the actual
                                cause could be unrelated, simply because weather data was poorly aligned spatially.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, while we attempted to spatially align weather data with our grid-based
                                framework, the lack of geographic diversity in the source data and the necessity of
                                random assignment led to inconsistencies that introduced noise and undermined the
                                predictive value of weather-based features. This experience highlights the critical
                                importance of spatially granular data when modeling urban phenomena that are sensitive
                                to local environmental conditions.</p>

                            <p>To better understand how individual weather variables influence our model’s predictions
                                of bike ride volumes, we performed a SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. SHAP
                                values quantify the contribution of each feature to a model's output for every
                                prediction, providing insight into which features are driving predictions up or down—and
                                under what conditions. The SHAP summary plot shown here reveals the influence of each
                                weather-related feature on the predicted bike demand across all grid cells and days in
                                our dataset. Each dot represents a single prediction instance, with the color indicating
                                the actual feature value (blue = low, red = high), and its position on the X-axis
                                representing the SHAP value (i.e., how much that feature increased or decreased the
                                model’s predicted ridership for that instance). Among all features, Feature 1 emerges as
                                the most consistently influential. High values of this feature (seen in red) are
                                strongly associated with positive SHAP values, meaning they significantly increase
                                predicted bike ride counts. This pattern is characteristic of a variable such as
                                temperature, where warmer days tend to encourage cycling. The model appears to learn
                                this relationship clearly and leverages it to adjust predictions accordingly. Feature 3
                                shows a more muted effect. Most SHAP values for this feature cluster tightly around
                                zero, indicating that the model doesn’t strongly rely on this variable. This could
                                represent relative humidity or cloud cover, factors that might influence comfort levels
                                but do not decisively affect biking behavior in most cases. Similarly, Feature 2 shows
                                minimal impact overall, with both low and high values resulting in weak and scattered
                                effects. This could point to a variable like wind speed or visibility, which likely
                                affect some riders but do not appear to consistently sway the model’s predictions.
                                Feature 6 presents an interesting case. While it contributes less frequently than the
                                others, high values are clearly associated with increased predicted ride volumes. This
                                sporadic but positive impact suggests it may represent a condition such as sunlight
                                hours or an indicator of clear skies—factors that, when present, can significantly boost
                                ridership but are not always present in the data. On the other hand, Features 4 and 5
                                are associated with negative impacts when their values are low (blue). In these cases,
                                SHAP values dip below zero, indicating a suppression of predicted ridership. These
                                features are likely tied to precipitation-related measures, such as rainfall amount or
                                storm probability. In poor weather conditions, especially rain, cycling activity tends
                                to drop sharply—a trend that the model appears to capture well. Lastly, Feature 0 shows
                                minimal influence across the board. Its SHAP values remain close to zero regardless of
                                whether the feature value is high or low, suggesting that the model largely ignores this
                                variable. This could be due to the feature being relatively constant in the dataset or
                                providing little useful information—possibly something like barometric pressure or dew
                                point, which may not vary meaningfully across urban areas or directly impact riding
                                behavior. All these results show that our dataset is not structured well enough to pass
                                to the model for testing the data. Although the dataset had different problems, the
                                prediction was not too bad.</p>

                            The training and validation loss (measured in mean squared error) show a noisy but downward
                            trend over the training period,
                            stabilizing to acceptable loss values after approximately 1800 epochs. Similarly, the mean
                            absolute error (MAE) for both training
                            and validation sets decreased steadily and remained closely aligned throughout the training
                            process, indicating that the model
                            generalized well and did not overfit. The small gap between training and validation errors
                            further supports the robustness of the
                            learned model.

                            To qualitatively assess model fit, we plotted predicted versus actual values. In the
                            training set, predictions clusterd tightly along the 45-degree reference line, indicating a
                            strong fit. In the test set, points were more scattered, but the model still captured the
                            dominant trend. We noted mild underprediction for low actual y values in the training set,
                            which could be attributed to limited representation in that region or the model’s inability
                            to capture complex nonlinear relationships.

                            The Linear Regression model explained 57% (<em>R<sup>2</sup> = 0.57</em>) of variance in
                            training data, reducing to 38% on test data. Test set predictions showed substantial
                            absolute errors, with squared errors suggesting presence of significant outliers.
                            Logarithmic transformation improved model stability, though back-transformed errors remained
                            substantial in original units. The performance gap of the linear regression between training
                            and test metrics (<em>&#916;R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2075</em>) suggests the limited capacity of
                            basic linear regression model to capture generalizable patterns and possible need for
                            non-linear modeling approaches.

                        <p>
                            The performance evaluation of three predictive models — <strong>Linear Regression</strong>,
                            <strong>Neural Network</strong>, and <strong>Decision Tree</strong> — reveals that the
                            Neural Network consistently outperforms the other two models across multiple statistical
                            metrics, both on the log-transformed and original data scale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Starting with the coefficient of determination <em>R<sup>2</sup></em>, which reflects the
                            proportion of the variance explained by each model, the Neural Network achieves the highest
                            score at <strong>0.731</strong>. This indicates that it explains approximately 73.1% of the
                            variability in the log-transformed target variable. In comparison, Linear Regression scores
                            a moderate <strong>0.38</strong>, while the Decision Tree lags behind at
                            <strong>0.21</strong>, showing limited explanatory power.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The result of the Neural Network is further supported by its performance on log-scale error
                            metrics. It achieves the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) at <strong>0.41</strong>,
                            significantly better than Linear Regression (<strong>1.69</strong>) and Decision Tree
                            (<strong>1.90</strong>). The WMSE value of <strong>0.248</strong> in the Neural Network
                            emphasizes the model’s accuracy and balanced treatment of data points with differing
                            importance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In assessing performance on the original scale of the target variable, the Neural Network
                            continues to lead with an MAE of <strong>8597.16</strong>, which is substantially lower than
                            Linear Regression’s error of <strong>3.88e+4</strong>. The Neural Network’s WMSE of <strong>3.082e+8</strong>
                            is far lower than Linear Regression’s MSE of <strong>6.71e+9</strong>, suggesting that the
                            Neural Network not only achieves better predictive accuracy but also manages prediction
                            variability more effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, the Neural Network clearly demonstrates the most robust performance among the
                            three models. It excels in capturing the variance of the data, minimizes both absolute and
                            squared errors, and leverages weighted error optimization to enhance its generalization
                            across different data points.

                        <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">6.2.1. Challenges in Generalizing NYC-Trained Models to Atlanta:
                            Demographic, Technical, and Ethical Considerations</h5>

                        <p>
                            As we sought to apply machine learning models trained on New York City (NYC) data to predict
                            bike activity patterns in Atlanta (ATL), we encountered several fundamental challenges that
                            impact the validity, fairness, and generalizability of our approach. These challenges span
                            demographic mismatches, dataset limitations, and ethical implications, all of which must be
                            addressed before interpreting the model’s predictions or using them for policy
                            recommendations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the most striking differences between NYC and ATL lies in population density. As
                            shown in the population density distribution graph, NYC census tracts have a mean density of
                            <strong>58,060 people per square mile</strong>, compared to only <strong>5,089 people per
                            square mile</strong> in Atlanta—a nearly tenfold difference. This extreme disparity places
                            Atlanta far outside the statistical range of the data used to train our model. In machine
                            learning terms, we are essentially extrapolating into a region of the input space that the
                            model has never seen, which raises serious concerns about model generalizability and
                            reliability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The model's assumptions, feature importance rankings, and learned patterns are tailored to
                            NYC's urban dynamics, where dense residential and commercial zones foster higher bike usage.
                            Applying this directly to a city like Atlanta—characterized by lower density, more car
                            dependency, and different infrastructure—risks drawing misleading conclusions unless
                            carefully adapted or retrained.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even within NYC, our model was trained on a relatively small and highly skewed dataset. We
                            had only <strong>377 grid squares</strong> containing Citibike stations, and while we
                            selected <strong>90 census features</strong> for training, the response variable—bike ride
                            count per grid—was heavily skewed, with most grid squares having low ride counts and a few
                            exhibiting very high usage. This imbalance makes it difficult for the model to learn subtle
                            patterns, particularly those that could transfer well to another city with vastly different
                            usage profiles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, machine learning methods—while powerful for detecting complex relationships—are
                            data-hungry. Learning a nonlinear mapping between demographic variables and bike activity
                            across a small number of spatial samples is prone to overfitting, even before generalizing
                            to another urban context. The risk is that the model memorizes NYC-specific patterns instead
                            of learning generalizable rules.

                        <p>
                            In addition to technical challenges, there are important ethical dimensions to our modeling
                            approach. Our predictions rely heavily on demographic data, such as income, race, education,
                            and age. Using these features introduces the risk of reinforcing existing biases,
                            particularly if the model associates low bike activity with historically underserved or
                            marginalized communities and fails to recommend infrastructure improvements in those areas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Moreover, we are training the model on Citibike data—a paid rideshare service—which is known
                            to have skews toward higher-income users. This means our data may underrepresent populations
                            that would benefit from improved bike access but currently lack the means to participate in
                            the system. If unaddressed, this could lead to recommendations that favor already advantaged
                            areas, exacerbating inequality rather than alleviating it.

                            Bike infrastructure has the potential to be a powerful egalitarian tool, promoting
                            sustainable transport, improving public health, and reducing dependency on cars. However,
                            the predictive modeling process must be critically evaluated to ensure it supports these
                            goals. We must compare our model outputs with additional datasets, perform localized
                            validations, and engage with community stakeholders before any conclusions are drawn or
                            policy decisions are made.

                        <p>
                            The violin plots above illustrate the distribution of population characteristics across
                            spatial units within New York City, offering insights into both total population and
                            population density at the local level. The left plot shows the distribution of total
                            population per unit, such as census tracts or grid cells. The shape of the plot reveals that
                            most spatial units in NYC have populations ranging between approximately 2,000 and 6,000
                            people. The embedded box plot highlights a median value near 4,000, with the majority of
                            data points clustered within a relatively narrow interquartile range.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the extended upper tail and presence of several outliers indicate that a few
                            locations are significantly more populated. These likely correspond to areas with dense
                            residential development, such as large apartment complexes or housing projects. Overall, the
                            distribution shows moderate right skewness, suggesting that while most areas have moderate
                            populations, there are a few with exceptionally high counts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast, the right plot displays the distribution of population density, measured in
                            people per square mile. This distribution is more sharply skewed and exhibits a broader
                            range of values. While a large number of spatial units fall between 30,000 and 100,000
                            people per square mile, the upper tail stretches dramatically, with some outliers reaching
                            densities above 250,000 per square mile. These extreme values likely reflect hyper-dense
                            urban cores—particularly neighborhoods in Manhattan—where residential, commercial, and
                            transit infrastructures are tightly packed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The stark contrast between the two distributions underscores a critical aspect of NYC’s
                            urban structure: while many neighborhoods have similar total populations, the land area they
                            occupy varies considerably, leading to highly uneven population densities. This variation
                            has practical implications for urban planning, especially for infrastructure projects such
                            as bike lanes, public transit, and emergency services, which must account not only for how
                            many people live in an area, but how densely they are concentrated.

                        <p>
                            We pre-processed Atlanta’s census data using the same methodology described in sections
                            <strong>5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.4, 5.3.6</strong>, and <strong>5.3.7</strong>. We selected the
                            same <strong>91 features</strong> from the US Census and normalized each feature using that
                            feature’s <strong>mean and variance from the NYC distribution</strong>. Although this
                            normalization method places Atlanta far outside of New York City’s range—especially for
                            population and population density—it is more consistent with the training distribution and
                            better aligns the features with the model’s expectations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is an important trade-off to consider: normalizing Atlanta’s data using NYC’s
                            parameters ensures compatibility with our trained model, but it also highlights how extreme
                            some ATL values are when viewed through a NYC-trained lens. Alternatively, normalizing based
                            on Atlanta’s own distribution would make ATL data appear more “standardized” but would
                            effectively <em>deceive the model</em>—making it believe Atlanta is more similar to NYC than
                            it actually is. We opted for NYC-based normalization to maintain methodological integrity,
                            despite the resulting statistical distance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We also created spatial grid cells for Atlanta using the same gridding methodology applied
                            to New York City. This involved defining bounding coordinates for the Atlanta metro area and
                            dividing the region into uniform rectangular cells. The latitude and longitude bounds used
                            for the Atlanta grid system are shown in the table below:

                        <p>
                            To enable consistent comparison and predictive modeling, we applied a grid-based
                            discretization approach to the city of Atlanta, identical to the method used for New York
                            City. The entire study area was divided into uniform spatial grid cells—each measuring
                            approximately 1,000 × 1,000 feet. For each grid cell, we aggregated and assigned demographic
                            information from the corresponding U.S. Census tracts. This included a wide range of
                            features such as population size, age distribution, income levels, racial composition,
                            education attainment, and housing characteristics. Once the demographic attributes were
                            associated with each grid cell, we passed these features through the machine learning models
                            trained on NYC data. These models, which included Random Forest, Linear Regression, and
                            Neural Networks, had been previously trained to learn relationships between demographic
                            patterns and observed bike ride volumes in NYC. By feeding the Atlanta grid-level
                            demographic data into these pre-trained models, we obtained predicted bike ride counts for
                            each cell across the city.

                        <p>
                            Once the predictive models were trained and validated using the NYC dataset, we moved into
                            the inference phase, where the models were used to generate predictions for unseen data—in
                            this case, Atlanta. Specifically, the grid-level demographic features from Atlanta were
                            passed as input into the trained models (<strong>Random Forest, Linear Regression, and
                            Neural Network</strong>). Since these models had learned patterns between demographics and
                            bike ride volumes in NYC, they produced corresponding predictions for each Atlanta grid
                            cell, estimating the expected level of bike activity.

                        <p>
                            This inference step was essential in translating NYC-learned insights into actionable
                            projections for Atlanta, especially in the absence of actual bike usage data. The outputs
                            allowed us to identify potential high-demand zones in Atlanta that may benefit from expanded
                            bike infrastructure, supporting data-driven urban planning and investment decisions.

                            The heatmaps displayed above illustrate the predicted bike ride demand across Atlanta as
                            generated by three different machine learning models: a <strong>Neural Network</strong>,
                            <strong>Linear Regression</strong>, and a <strong>Decision Tree</strong>. These predictions
                            were derived using grid-level demographic features from Atlanta, passed through models
                            trained on New York City data. While each model shares the same input, their spatial
                            predictions differ significantly in terms of distribution, concentration, and spread of
                            high-demand areas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <strong>Neural Network</strong> model produces a widespread and multi-centered pattern
                            of predicted bike demand. High-activity zones appear in multiple parts of the city,
                            including the southwest, west, and pockets in the north. This indicates the model's ability
                            to capture nonlinear and complex relationships between demographics and predicted bike
                            usage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Its flexibility allows it to detect nuanced patterns across diverse neighborhoods,
                            potentially identifying both traditionally dense areas and emerging zones of interest.
                            However, this broader spread could also reflect overgeneralization or overfitting,
                            especially given the small size of the training dataset (377 grid cells).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In contrast, the <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model yields a more concentrated and
                            centralized prediction. The most intense hotspot lies near the Old Fourth Ward and Midtown
                            area, suggesting the model heavily weights variables linearly correlated with dense,
                            high-income, or active zones.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While this outcome is more interpretable and reflects a traditional urban core dynamic, it
                            may miss subtler patterns in lower-density or transitional neighborhoods due to its
                            inability to model nonlinear interactions. The sharpness of the hotspot also indicates
                            potential sensitivity to outliers or skewed features in the demographic input.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <strong>Decision Tree</strong> model produces an output somewhere between the previous
                            two in terms of spread. It captures distinct patches of high predicted demand, mostly around
                            major roads and central areas, but lacks the smooth gradation seen in the Neural Network’s
                            map.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Decision Trees work through hierarchical rules and splits, which may explain the more blocky
                            and segmented prediction structure. While this method handles feature interactions better
                            than linear models, it is still prone to overfitting and lacks the generalization capacity
                            of ensemble methods or deep learning.

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The model predictions largely align with our expectations, reinforcing known urban trends in
                            Atlanta. The central corridor extending from Midtown down to the Hotel District emerges as a
                            prominent hotspot, reflecting high predicted bike activity. This result is intuitive given
                            that this corridor is densely populated and home to a predominantly young, urban
                            demographic—a population segment that is typically more likely to cycle, especially for
                            short commutes, recreation, or last-mile transit connections.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another major area of predicted activity is Buckhead, located in the northern section of the
                            city. This, too, is unsurprising—Buckhead is a dense, well-developed area with a growing
                            number of mixed-use developments and commercial centers. The model identifies it as a
                            high-demand zone, likely due to its demographic characteristics and potential for multimodal
                            commuting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A third significant cluster appears near Clark Atlanta University, which again matches
                            expectations. This area includes a large concentration of students and young residents, all
                            within a walkable and bikeable urban core. The elevated predicted activity suggests that a
                            student-heavy population correlates strongly with potential cycling uptake—something
                            consistently supported by academic literature and urban transportation studies.

                        <h6 class="text-primary mb-2">Notable Inconsistencies and Model Limitations</h6>

                        <p>
                            Despite these confirmations, some results from the model deviate from our real-world
                            understanding, raising important questions about model bias and data limitations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One example is Georgia Tech, which, despite being a large urban campus with a known biking
                            culture, is only predicted to have slightly elevated activity. Given that a significant
                            portion of the student body commutes by bike or uses cycling for campus mobility, this
                            underprediction likely reflects a regression to the mean effect. Grid squares with low total
                            population but strong niche biking behavior may be averaged down by the model, especially
                            under demographic-only predictors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another questionable prediction is for Downtown Atlanta. Despite being one of the densest
                            and most central areas of the city, the model forecasts relatively low bike activity. A
                            plausible explanation is that downtown, while dense, is also economically disadvantaged
                            compared to Midtown or Buckhead. Since the model was trained on NYC data—where higher-income
                            areas may show higher ridership due to the Citibike program’s subscription-based model—this
                            could lead to biased predictions against low-income regions in Atlanta.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is a critical reminder that model output should not be accepted at face value,
                            especially when extrapolating across different socioeconomic contexts.

                        <p>
                            Using the model’s output as a guide, we manually placed proposed bike lanes, shown in red on
                            the map. These recommendations focus on:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>1. Targeting high-demand zones:</strong> such as Midtown, Buckhead, and the
                            university district.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>2. Improving network connectivity:</strong> ensuring that isolated high-demand areas
                            are better linked through continuous infrastructure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>3. Closing infrastructure gaps:</strong> especially in underserved but promising
                            regions—areas where model predictions may be conservative due to population or income
                            biases, but where community-level cycling behavior is likely underrepresented in the data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By combining model-driven insights with local intuition and known patterns of urban
                            behavior, these proposed additions aim to expand access, promote equity, and support
                            increased bike usage citywide.

                            Engineering</h5>

                        <p>
                            To further improve the accuracy and relevance of our predictive model and infrastructure
                            recommendations, the following steps are proposed:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Future iterations of the model should take into account origin-destination flows between
                            residential neighborhoods and commercial or employment centers. Understanding commute-based
                            movement patterns will allow for more realistic predictions of daily bike traffic,
                            especially during peak hours.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This will also help identify corridors where demand surges in the morning and evening,
                            offering guidance for time-sensitive infrastructure improvements such as directional bike
                            lanes or signal prioritization.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our current model is trained primarily on rental data (e.g., Citibike usage), which may
                            underrepresent the full picture of urban cycling behavior. Many cyclists—particularly in
                            underserved communities or areas without bikeshare coverage—rely on privately owned
                            bicycles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Incorporating survey data, traffic counters, or crowd-sourced apps (e.g., Strava Metro)
                            could provide a more comprehensive view of total bike activity, enabling models to better
                            serve all types of riders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By expanding the scope of data and behavioral insights included in the modeling process, we
                            can move closer to developing equitable, data-informed infrastructure plans that reflect the
                            full spectrum of Atlanta’s cycling dynamics.

                            We plan to use K-Means clustering to extract latent patterns from the dataset. An
                            unsupervised K-Means algorithm was applied to the NYC census dataset, which resulted in the
                            identification of four distinct clusters (Cluster 0, 1, 2, and 3).

                        <p>
                            Each cluster represents a grouping of similar conditions based on proximity to their
                            respective centroid (mean) values in feature space.

                            Regression and Neural Networks, enabling the algorithms to learn how cluster membership
                            influences ride volume. By examining the resulting model outputs—e.g., ridership levels per
                            cluster:

                        <p>
                            This allows the two models; Linear Regression and Neural Networks to learn how being in a
                            certain cluster relates to ridership. So, the result tells us: Which cluster most of the
                            ridership belongs to (which can also help us evaluate whether the results are reasonable or
                            not). And at the end we can compare the results for NYC and Atlanta. This comparative
                            analysis
                            between New York City and Atlanta could reveal whether the dominant ridership clusters are
                            consistent across cities. Since clusters in NYC are different from ATL, we can ask:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Do high-ridership conditions in NYC align with similar cluster types in Atlanta, or are
                                the
                                patterns fundamentally different?</em> Such a comparison would generalize findings and
                            understand the contextual drivers of urban micromobility usage across different metropolitan
                            areas.
